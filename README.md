# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect innerHTML Usage

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the usage of `innerHTML` in HTML.  While the provided code may seem to work correctly, it highlights a potential pitfall that can lead to unexpected behavior and should be avoided for better code maintainability and robustness.

The bug arises from repeatedly using `innerHTML` to append content to an element.  While functional in this simple example, more complex scenarios might encounter issues (e.g., race conditions or unintended overwriting).  Best practices suggest utilizing DOM manipulation methods (such as `appendChild`) for more predictable and reliable results.
